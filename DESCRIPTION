Title: Finds the Price of Anarchy for Routing Games
Version: 1.2.1
Author: Hector Haffenden
Maintainer: Hector Haffenden <haffendenh@cardiff.ac.uk>
Description: Computes the optimal flow, Nash flow and the Price of Anarchy for any routing game defined within the game theoretical framework. The input is a routing game in the form of itâ€™s cost and flow functions. Then transforms this into an optimisation problem, allowing both Nash and Optimal flows to be solved by nonlinear optimisation. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_game> and Knight et al (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2013.04.003> for more information.
